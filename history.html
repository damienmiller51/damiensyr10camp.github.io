                         The Tititea Lodge up at Mt. Aspiring is a very important place for many Dunstan students, ex-students, teachers and others. The lodge <br> was originally a home for the Aspinall family, but they sold up when they built their new house further down the valley. This was in the <br> early 1970's. Dunstan have been using it from around 1973. Originally, all the land up the back of the lodge was farmland, and you <br> could graze cows on it, but when it changed hands the owners began to regenerate the bush in the area.

             	 	 Originally, the Year 10 camps were 7 nights long, and they did a lot more things than we do these days. They would take large hikes up <br> to the Snowy (Glacier Burn) and go <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bouldering"> Bouldering</a> for a day. But the teachers found that the students began to get a little bored, and so they <br> shortened it to 4 nights, and it has been like that ever since.
